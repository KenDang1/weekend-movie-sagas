## Description

I had a hard time to figure out where to start like which part should I start first so I can lay the next block.  I was working all over the place, like starting at the details component but then I figure I needed other parts to make it work. So finally I decide to do the I movieItem first then from there I know where to go next and then trouble shooting or debugging took awhile.  Also the query part took me sometimes to get it right.  

Next is the genres all crumble up which I'm still don't know how to render it nicely out.  Also when I refresh the detail page it went into ERROR mode, and this is the params part Edan talked about which I hope to get it tomorrow. 1 AM on Saturday, too tired.
